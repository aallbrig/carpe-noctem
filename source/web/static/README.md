### Web Static Assets
This is the folder for static web assets.  For the uninitiated, this is the source code that ultimately compiles into the raw HTML/CSS/JS that is served to the end user.

### Getting Started
Run `npm install` or `npm i` in this directory to install all required packages.

Run `npm start` for development.

Run `npm run compileDist` to create `dist` folder.

Run `npm run serveDist` to test that _static_ asserts are serving up correctly.

(Note: you can combine these two commands into a one-liner `npm run compileDist && npm run serveDist`)

### Running
Please run `npm start` to begin development.

Please run `TODO add prod to package.json` to start server in production mode.
